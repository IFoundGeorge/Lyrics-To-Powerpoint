# Lyrics To Powerpoint
 
 Dear users,

I would like to introduce myself as the developer of this program, Cyrus. I have created this program for the benefit of people, especially for worship teams who struggle to create PowerPoint presentations. 

This program makes it easy to create lyrics for your PowerPoint presentations with just one click.

Although the program is fully functional, there are still some features that I plan to add in the future. For instance, 

I plan to convert the program for mobile users to use. 

Additionally, I will add an option to add backgrounds for your presentations, 

a dragable HUD to position text boxes, options to select font, size of the text, and whether the text is centered, and more.

For now, the program is still in beta, but I am confident that it will meet your expectations. Please feel free to to use the Issue tab and send your problems of the program or bugs on the program that you don't know how to fix, and I would gladly help you as much as possible.

Thank you for using this program.

Best regards,
Developer Cyrus.
